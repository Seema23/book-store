In his lifetime, he saw Britain ravaged by Napoleonic wars, revived by the Industrial Revolution, and embarked upon a new moment of Imperial glory with the ascendancy of Queen Victoria. His own life embodied astonishing transformation. Born the son of a barber in Covent Garden, he was buried amid pomp and ceremony in St. Paul\'s Cathedral. \r\nTurner was accepted into the prestigious Royal Academy at the height of the French Revolution when a climate of fear dominated Britain. Unable to travel abroad he explored at home, reimagining the landscape to create some of the most iconic scenes of his country. But his work always had a profound human element. When a moment of peace allowed travel into Europe, Turner was one of the first artists to capture the beauty of the Alps, to revive Venice as a subject, and to follow in Byron’s footsteps through the Rhine country.', 'Penguin Press', '2016', '0735220921', 528, 2000, 'upload_image/Book4.jpg', 'upload_ebook/art1.docx'),

When Boston CSI Darby McCormick finds a raving and emaciated woman hiding at the scene of a violent kidnap, she runs a DNA search to identify the Jane Doe. The result confirms that the woman was abducted five years earlier and has somehow managed to escape from the dungeon in which she?s been caged. With a teenage couple also missing and the Jane Doe seriously ill, the clock is ticking for Darby as she hunts for the dungeon before anyone else disappears or dies. And when the FBI takes over the investigation, it becomes clear that a sadistic serial killer has been on the prowl for decades ? and is poised to strike again at any moment. A killer with links to horrors that Darby has desperately tried to bury in her past?\r\n\r\n', 'Chris Mooning ', '2006', '0141030852', 416, 240, 'upload_image/fic1.jpg', 'upload_ebook/fiction1.docx'),

(48, 'Bill and Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World`s Gre', '12', 'This is not a history of the Hewlett-Packard Company, or a book of business theory, or a definitive biography of William Hewlett and David Packard. I have chosen to write this book this way because of the desperate need the business world has right now for an archetype of enlightened management, enduring quality, and perpetual innovation. It is not enough to simply tell the story of Hewlett, Packard and their company. What are needed are the why? and the how?? The most momentous first meeting in modern business history took place in the unlikely setting of a bench beside a football field, between two Stanford University students in pads and helmets. A few years later, in 1938, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were working in a small garage in Palo Alto, California, building their first product, an audio oscillator. It was the start not only of a legendary company but also of an entire way of life in Silicon Valley?and, ultimately, of our modern digital age. Acclaimed journalist Michael S. Malone is the first to get the full story, based on unlimited and exclusive access to corporate and private archives, along with hundreds of employee interviews. He draws on new material to show how some of the most influential products of our time were invented and how a culture of innovation led HP to unparalleled success for decades. Malone also shows what was really behind the groundbreaking management philosophy??the HP way??that put people ahead of products or profits. Bill and Dave, at its heart, is a character study of two amazing men who revealed their character in how they structured their business, in the men and women they hired, and, most of all, in the power they entrusted to even the lowliest HP employee. Their story is something of a miracle?one from which we can never stop learning.', 'Michael S. Malone ', '2005', '0143102397', 345, 500, 'upload_image/MANAGEMENT2.jpg', 'upload_ebook/mgmt1.pptx'),

(50, 'Learning SQL on SQL Server 2005 : The Simplest Way', '18', 'Anyone who interacts with today?s modern databases needs to know SQL (Structured Query Language), the standard language for generating, manipulating, and retrieving database information. In recent years, the dramatic rise in the popularity of relational databases and multiuser databases has fueled a healthy demand for application devel?opers and others who can write SQL code efficiently and correctly. If you?re new to databases or need a SQL refresher, Learning SQL on SQL Server 2005 is an ideal step-by-step introduction to this database query tool, with everything you need for programming SQL using Microsoft?s SQL Server 2005?one of the most powerful and popular database engines used today. Plenty of books explain database theory. This guide lets you apply the theory as you learn SQL. You don?t need prior database knowledge, or even prior computer knowledge. Based on a popular university-level course designed by authors Sikha Saha Bagui and Richard Walsh Earp, Learning SQL on SQL Server 2005 starts with very simple SQL concepts, and slowly builds into more complex query development. Every topic, concept, and idea comes with examples of code and output, along with exercises to help you gain proficiency in SQL and SQL Server 2005. With this book, you?ll learn: * Beginning SQL commands, such as how and where to type an SQL query, and how to create, populate, alter, and delete tables * How to customize SQL Server 2005?s settings and about SQL Server 2005?s functions * About joins, a common database mechanism for combining tables * Query development, the use of views and other derived structures, and simple set operations * Subqueries, aggregate functions, and correlated subqueries, as well as indexes and constraints that can be added to tables in SQL Server 2005 Whether you?re a self-learner who has access to the new Microsoft database, working on SQL Server with access at your company, or a computer science student or MIS student, Learning SQL on SQL Server 2005 will get you up to speed on SQL in no time.\r\n\r\n', 'Sikha Saha Bagui, Richard Walsh Earp ', '2005', '9788184040', 360, 350, 'upload_image/comp10.jpg', 'upload_ebook/sql1.docx');
